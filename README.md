This project was coded for a speedy mintbean hackathon challenge in only an hour and a half. It's made with React.js and uses ChartJS to visualize the data from the API call. As you can tell, I definitely tend to prioritize functionality before styling and finishing. If I were to do this over again, I would probably take my time and write everything out in vanilla Javascript to write some custom functionality and flex some of my CSS skills.
